	/// 
	/// Standard: To allow the use of types in a namespace so that you do not have to qualify the use of a type in that namespace:
	///   using System.Text;
	/// 
	/// Static: To allow you to access static members of a type without having to qualify the access with the type name:
	///   using static System.Math;
	/// 
	/// Alias: To create an alias for a namespace or a type. This is called a using alias directive.
	///   using Project = PC.MyCompany.Project;
